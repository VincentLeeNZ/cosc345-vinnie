Our idea is a stock market simulator game. The objective of the game is to generate as much money as you can over the 100 years of your life. Everyone starts with a million US dollars and must use stocks, property, ETFs, precious metals, cryptocurrency, and more to generate income. Players can even get an education and a job in the game to earn extra income. High scores are stored in an online leaderboard.

Investment data is predicted based on real world stock data and financial news. Company events including earnings reports will be randomly generated based on history and the stock market data will react as it did previously across history.
